
# Hand Detection and Finger Counting with OpenCV

**Summary**

This project implements a real-time hand detection and finger counting system using OpenCV. By leveraging accumulated background averaging, contour detection, and segmentation, it identifies the hand within a region of interest and counts the number of extended fingers. The project is designed for robust performance in custom environments, with a clear graphical display of results.
